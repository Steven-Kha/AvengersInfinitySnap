# AvengersInfinitySnap

Idea inspired by Resetera's endgame hype thread.

All the members of the 2018-2019 acm club's fate shall be decided by a wish to keep the finite universe balanced. 

Each children of Thanos will paired with another and the stones will decide which of the two survives or is sacrificed for the greater good

The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

# How to run

This code runs in either Python 2.7.9 or the latest one since April 2nd 2019 (lol)

But the screen output text works best with Python 2.7.9. 

You can play around the timer if it takes too long or slow for it to proceed. 

Default is 3 seconds to read who is up and 6 seconds to read their fate and how many names are left to be judged.
