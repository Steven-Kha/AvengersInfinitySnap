"# AvengersInfinitySnap" 

Idea inspired by Resetera's endgame hype thread.

All the members of the 2018-2019 acm club's fate shall be decided by a wish to keep the finite universe balanced. 

Each children of Thanos will paired with another and the stones will decide which of the two survives or is sacrificed for the greater good

The strongest choices require the strongest wills.
